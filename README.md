## computer vision

In this project as part of arch.ai we designed and developed a basic hand tracker using mediapipe and performed classification on detected hand landmark points

# OpenCV
OpenCV is a library used for computer vision applications. With help of OpenCV, we can build an enormous number of applications that work better in real-time. Mainly it is used for image and video processing.

# MediaPipe
MediaPipe is a framework mainly used for building audio, video, or any time series data. Using this we can build very impressive pipelines for different media processing functions.
